<!-- 
tailwindcss is used to load Tailwind CSS via CDN (Content Delivery Network) directly into an HTML file.
used : Quick prototyping - Demos or playgrounds - Simple static HTML files (without complex build steps)
not used: Production projects (because it's slower and less customizable)
          If you want: Purge unused CSS for performance - Customize Tailwind config (e.g., themes, plugins) - Add custom utilities
